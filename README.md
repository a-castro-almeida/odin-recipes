The Odin Project: Recipes

@a-castro-almeida
This project is probably going to allow for a better comprehension of the process of creating an html website. I expect to consolidate the knowlegde aquired during the time spent on The Odin Project website. 

Topics I expect to go through:
    - HTML tags and elements
    - HTML attributes
    - Git actions
    - Tagging commits
